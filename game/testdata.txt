PASSAGE:

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

"Whenever you feel like criticising any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't _____(1) the advantages that you've had."

He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually _____(7) in a reserved way, and I understood that he _____(5) a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to _____(4) and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when _____(3) appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are _____(10) _____(6) and marred _____(2) obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a _____(8) of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
